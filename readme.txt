It's a simple educational game to demonstrate Brownian motion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) to school students. All the game is about steering the rocket to avoid collisions with asteroids, and pick up resources, scoring points for them. The game time is configurable and limited.
The clue of the game is the hardware, it should have multiple joystics connected, and be capable of summarizing their state.
